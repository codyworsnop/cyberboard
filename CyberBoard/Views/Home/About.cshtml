        <p>This project was created by Cody Worsnop, Amir Behmaram, and Tyler Frasca
           of the University of Nevada Reno for their CS 151 class.</p>
        <p>The main purpose of the website is to search twitter for tweets 
           relating to cybersecurity or cyber attacks so people have an easy way 
           stay up to date on recent cyber attacks.</p>
        <p>We decided this would be easier than doing a presentation. Public speaking sucks.</p>
